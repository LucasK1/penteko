# penteko
A reactive corporate site designed and developed for a environmental expertise company https://penteko.pl

My aim in creating this site was for it to be simple, concise, and to the point.
I created it having in mind its main users - technically oriented people who want to get the information they want quickly, not having to wait for the site to load, no fancy effects.
Even though these users most probably would be accessing this site on PCs, following current standards I made it responsive.
